/**
 * This script analyzes the parent registration flow and proposes fixes
 * for the issue where parent name isn't shown in the welcome message
 * until after visiting the settings page.
 */

// First, let's identify where the registration flow is implemented
// and how the parent data is loaded in the home screen

const registrationFlowAnalysis = `
REGISTRATION FLOW ANALYSIS:

1. Current Flow:
   - Parent fills registration form (name, phone, email, password)
   - Auth account is created in Supabase
   - Parent record is created in the database with user_id reference
   - Parent is directly taken to their account/home screen
   - Welcome message doesn't show parent name initially
   - Only after visiting settings, the welcome message shows the name

2. Issue:
   - Parent data isn't being properly fetched after registration
   - The home screen might be loading before parent data is available
   - Auth state exists, but parent profile data isn't loaded

3. Proposed Solution:
   - After successful registration, show a welcome/success message
   - Redirect to login screen instead of directly to the home screen
   - When user logs in, ensure parent data is fully loaded before showing home screen
   - Implement proper loading states during data fetching
`;

const codeChanges = `
CODE CHANGES NEEDED:

1. ParentRegistrationScreen.tsx:
   - After successful registration, show success message
   - Redirect to login screen instead of home screen
   - Add a short delay to ensure database operations complete

2. ParentHomeScreen.tsx:
   - Ensure parent data is loaded when component mounts
   - Add proper loading state during data fetching
   - Don't render welcome message until parent data is available

3. ParentContext.tsx or similar state management:
   - Ensure parent profile is loaded whenever auth state changes
   - Add loading state to track when parent data is being fetched
   - Provide methods to refresh parent data when needed
`;

const implementationPlan = `
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:

1. Modify ParentRegistrationScreen.tsx:
   - After registration success, show a toast/alert with welcome message
   - Navigate to login screen instead of home screen
   - Add code comment explaining this flow

2. Modify ParentHomeScreen.tsx:
   - Add useEffect to fetch parent data on component mount
   - Add loading state while data is being fetched
   - Only show welcome message with name when data is available
   - Add refresh control to allow manual refresh

3. Modify parent context/provider:
   - Ensure parent data is loaded whenever auth state changes
   - Add loading state to track when parent data is being fetched
   - Provide methods to refresh parent data when needed

4. Test the flow:
   - Register a new parent account
   - Verify redirect to login screen with welcome message
   - Log in with the new account
   - Verify parent name appears in welcome message immediately
