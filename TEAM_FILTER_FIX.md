# Team Filter Data Isolation Fix

## The Problem

The team selector in the filter modal was showing teams from all clubs, not just the current user's club. This was a data isolation issue where the filter options weren't being properly filtered by club_id, even though the actual data display was correctly filtered.

## The Solution

We've implemented multiple fixes to ensure proper data isolation:

### 1. New FilterTeamsModal Component

We created a dedicated component (`src/screens/FilterTeamsFix.tsx`) that:
- Directly queries the database for teams filtered by the current user's club_id
- Uses multiple methods to determine the user's club_id (AsyncStorage, admin check, coach check)
- Properly handles loading states and errors

### 2. Enhanced getUserClubId Function

We improved the `getUserClubId` function in `src/services/activitiesService.ts` to:
- Add more debugging
- Handle error cases better
- Cache the club_id in AsyncStorage for future use

### 3. SQL Migration

We created a SQL migration (`supabase/migrations/20250701_fix_team_data_isolation.sql`) that:
- Improves the `get_user_teams_direct` function
- Adds a new `get_teams_by_club_direct` function for testing
- Updates RLS policies for the teams table

## How to Apply These Fixes

### 1. Apply the Frontend Changes

1. Copy the new files:
   - `src/screens/FilterTeamsFix.tsx`

2. Update the existing files:
   - `src/screens/AttendanceReportsScreen.tsx` - Replace the `renderTeamFilterModal` function with the new `FilterTeamsModal` component
   - `src/services/activitiesService.ts` - Update the `getUserClubId` function with the enhanced version

### 2. Apply the SQL Migration

1. Run the SQL migration:
   - Copy the SQL from `supabase/migrations/20250701_fix_team_data_isolation.sql`
   - Paste it into the Supabase SQL Editor and run it

### 3. Test the Fix

After applying both frontend and backend changes:

1. Log in as different administrators (e.g., `radu.petre@gmail.com`, `ponta.m@gmail.com`, `prec.florin@gmail.com`)
2. Navigate to the Attendance Reports screen
3. Open the team filter modal
4. Verify that each admin only sees teams from their own club

## Debugging

If issues persist:

1. Check the browser console logs for any errors
2. Look for the debug logs from the `getUserClubId` function in the Supabase logs
3. Verify that the `loadTeams` function is correctly retrieving teams filtered by club_id

## Additional Notes

This fix ensures proper data isolation at the UI level. The backend already had proper RLS policies, but the frontend was not correctly applying the club_id filter when loading teams for the filter modal.

The new approach directly queries the database with the club_id filter every time the filter modal is opened, ensuring that only teams from the current user's club are displayed.
