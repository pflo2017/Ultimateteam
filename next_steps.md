# Next Steps to Fix the Team Data Isolation Bug

## The Issue
The bug was in the team selector filter modal, which was showing teams from all clubs rather than just the current user's club. While the data display correctly filtered by club_id, the filter options didn't have the same restriction.

## What We've Fixed

1. **Frontend Fix (AttendanceReportsScreen.tsx)**:
   - Removed the temporary filter that was only showing "Team test"
   - Modified the `renderTeamFilterModal` function to use the properly filtered teams array
   - The `loadTeams` function already had the correct approach to filter teams by club_id

2. **Backend Fix (SQL Migration)**:
   - Created an improved version of the `get_user_teams_direct` function with better debugging
   - Added a new function `get_teams_by_club_direct` for direct testing
   - Fixed RLS policies for the teams table to ensure proper data isolation

## How to Apply These Fixes

### 1. Apply the Frontend Changes
The changes to `src/screens/AttendanceReportsScreen.tsx` have already been applied. Make sure to rebuild and deploy the app.

### 2. Apply the SQL Migration
Since the CLI approach didn't work, you'll need to:

1. **Copy the SQL from the migration file**:
   - Open `supabase/migrations/20250701_fix_team_data_isolation.sql`
   - Copy all the SQL code

2. **Run it in the Supabase SQL Editor**:
   - Log in to the Supabase dashboard
   - Go to the SQL Editor
   - Paste the SQL code and run it

### 3. Test the Fix

After applying both frontend and backend changes:

1. Log in as different administrators (e.g., `radu.petre@gmail.com`, `ponta.m@gmail.com`, `prec.florin@gmail.com`)
2. Navigate to the Attendance Reports screen
3. Open the team filter modal
4. Verify that each admin only sees teams from their own club

## Additional Debugging

If issues persist:

1. Check the browser console logs for any errors
2. Look for the debug logs from the `get_user_teams_direct` function in the Supabase logs
3. Verify that the `loadTeams` function is correctly retrieving teams filtered by club_id

## Potential Edge Cases

- New users/clubs: Make sure new clubs are properly isolated from existing data
- Multiple roles: Test with users who have multiple roles (e.g., admin and coach)
- Edge case: Test with users who have no associated club_id
